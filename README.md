# Disney Quiz
![Disney quiz](assets/images_md/disney_responsive.png)
This is a responsive site with a quiz. The quiz has 10 Disney-related questions with four answer options per question. You get one chance on each question, but you can redo the game as many times as you want. The quiz can be played by a wide age range of people and is an easily navigated game/site.

## About the site
The site features a simple home page with a logo in the header which is clickable back to the home page. It also has a welcoming text as well as instructions about the quiz. Under the information text there is an image of a Mickey Mouse clock with matching colors to the gradient background (#eea8ca and #f8ee9a). After the image you'll find a "Lets Play" button that will take you to the quiz.At the bottom of the page you'l find the footer which includes three social media icons to: Facebook, X and Instagram. All icons are linked to their respective pages and opens in new tabs. 

On the game site there will still be the same background, header logo and footer icons. On this page you will find the acual quiz being presented, one question at a time and with four answer options per question. Under the options there's a "Next" button that will present the next question. You are not able to press the "Next" button if you haven't chosen an option first. 

When an option has been chosen you will find out straight away if the asnwer is correct. If the answer is correct the option button you have chosen will turn green. If it is incorrect it will turn red and the correct answer will be shown in green. 

At the end of the game you will find your score saying how many points you got out of how many questions. Under the score you'll have a button saying "Play Again" which will take you back to the beginning of the quiz.
